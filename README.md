##Purpose of the repository
--

We have been working for Britta, she is part of Amazing Prime and we are working in cleaning some data to launch a challenge that will benefit the company called the hackatton.

In order to be able to clean the data (two sources: Wikipedia and Kaggle) and build a clean database for the challenge we need to implement ETL process Extract, Transform, Load.

By using ETL we will create a pipeline from Raw data to be able to use SQL to build a databese by using Python to extract data from disparate sources, clean the data with Pandas and we used regular exresions to parse data and to transform text to numbers. 

By following this proces we were abel to deliver requested information.
